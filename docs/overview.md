│   ├── settings.py       # Project configuration
│   ├── urls.py          # URL routing
│   └── wsgi.py          # WSGI configuration
└── apps/                 # Future application modules
```

## Tech Stack Details
- Python 3.x
- Django 4.2+ (Web Framework)

  - PostgreSQL for production
  - Redis for caching
  - Celery for async tasks
